# Exploit-Pack
This pack I put together contains over 40 weaponized exploits, mostly linux but also windows, mostly written in python I used to mine Monero (XMR) on exploited machines.
I quit mining XMR because I kept getting banned. If you have a shodan account you can grab vulnerable devices for each exploit and get big hashrates. I was running at 1.5MH/s before I decided to quit and release this.
Use XMRIG-PROXY to prevent ban on pools! Happy mining!
